summary: "With the design patterns in this book, you�ll be able to build PHP applications much more efficiently. Learning PHP Design Patterns shows you how to use patterns through simple examples, and then demonstrates many of them in full-fledged working applications. You�ll learn patterns that help you connect PHP and MySQL, as well as several pattern categories that encapsulate object-oriented programming practices and concepts, such as polymorphism.These patterns allow you to adopt a more sophisticated programming style, focusing on language improvements introduced in PHP 5. You�ll also learn patterns that help you avoid common programming problems."
