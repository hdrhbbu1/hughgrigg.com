I was the sole developer on ChinaCheckup.com from 2013 to 2014, handling all
front-end and back-end development, as well as managing the server.

China Checkup sells complex business analysis services to clients outside of
China. The site is a custom ecommerce solution based on the Laravel framework.
It automates much of the workflow in creating, modifying and selling these
services to clients.

Some time after I left the company, China Checkup migrated to the Shopify
platform.
