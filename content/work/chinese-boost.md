As East Asia Student got increasingly eclectic and unfocused, I decided to
branch off the 'how to learn Chinese' content to this new site. Like my other
text-based sites, Chinese Boost is built using Hugo and hosted with AWS.

I get quite a lot of nice feedback from people saying how useful they find
Chinese Boost.
