The project that got me into web development! I started this Wordpress site in
2010 knowing nothing about web development. I've since come to dislike
Wordpress, but tinkering with it got me interested in this type of work.

East Asia Student was more active whilst I was at university, but I still add
new content from time to time. The site is now built using Hugo and hosted with
AWS.
