<h2>Love Knitting</h2>

<a href="http://www.loveknitting.com/">
    <img class="project-img"
        src="/img/2014/11/loveknitting.png"
        alt="Love Knitting homepage" />
</a>

<p>
    My full-time employer. Currently I work mostly on the back-end, which is a
    heavily customised Magento EE installation.
</p>

<h2>China Checkup</h2>

<a href="https://www.chinacheckup.com/">
    <img class="project-img"
        src="/img/2014/11/chinacheckup.png"
        alt="China Checkup homepage" />
</a>

<p>
    I was the sole developer on
    <a href="https://www.chinacheckup.com/">ChinaCheckup.com</a> from 2013 to
    2014, handling all front-end and back-end development, as well as managing
    the server.
</p>

<p>
    China Checkup sells complex business analysis services to clients outside of
    China. The site is a custom ecommerce solution based on the
    <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> framework. It automates much
    of the workflow in creating, modifying and selling these services to
    clients.
</p>

<p>
    The design is strictly object-oriented and modular, with a consistently
    structured schema to persist it. Combined with a test-driven-development
    approach from the start, this made development very satisfying and enjoyable
    as the project grew. Laravel was a big help here, as the framework
    facilitates good application design and development practices.

<h2>East Asia Student</h2>

<a href="http://eastasiastudent.net/">
    <img class="project-img"
        src="/img/2014/11/eastasiastudent.png"
        alt="East Asia Student homepage" />
</a>

<p>
    The project that got me into web development! I started this Wordpress site
    in 2010 knowing nothing about web development. I've since come to dislike
    Wordpress, but tinkering with it got me interested in this type of work.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://eastasiastudent.net/">East Asia Student</a> was more active
    whilst I was at university, but I still add new content from time to time.
</p>

<h2>Chinese Boost</h2>

<a href="http://www.chineseboost.com/">
    <img class="project-img"
        src="/img/2014/11/chineseboost.png"
        alt="Chinese Boost homepage" />
</a>

<p>
    As East Asia Student got increasingly eclectic and unfocused, I decided to
    branch off the 'how to learn Chinese' content to this new site.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.chineseboost.com/">Chinese Boost</a> is in need of a
    redesign, which I plan to combine with a move to the Jekyll site engine.
</p>

<h2>Chinese Grammar</h2>

<a href="http://www.chinesegrammar.info/">
    <img class="project-img"
        src="/img/2014/11/chinesegrammar.png"
        alt="Chinese Grammar homepage" />
</a>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.chinesegrammar.info/">ChineseGrammar.info</a> is,
    surprisingly, about Chinese grammar. I get quite a lot of nice feedback from
    people saying how useful they find it.
</p>

<p>
    Chinese Grammar is very much in need of a re-design. I'm also planning to
    move it to Jekyll.
